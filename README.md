# Superstore-Sales
### Superstore Data Visualization and Exploration
This is my KaggleX Project on Data Visualization and Exploration using Python (Part 1). 
In this part i explored the features of this dataset and build an interactive charts with Plotly. I also built and interactive dashbord using Streamlit, the link can be found [Here](https://m35jf2fj6buemnvpxvmwfk.streamlit.app/).

I looked at the Region with more sales, Product Segment customers buys more per each region, total sales and profit. I also looked at the yearly sales and profit, shipping mode customers prefer to use and i looked at the number of customers each region has. All these and more can be found in the jupyter notebook file.

The dataset used can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)

My github repo where i explain more about the data can be found [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)


I equally wrote and article on medium, [Here](https://medium.com/@oriji.sandra_21900/building-interactive-charts-with-plotly-07a379452c74)

The Part 2 will be on Forecasting with Prophet.

* **Please Note**:
GitHub is not displaying the charts in my notebook, so to view i added it to jupyter nbviewer. So to view the interactive plot charts use this link [Here](https://nbviewer.org/github/Onyinye91-ctrl/Superstore-Sales/blob/main/stores.ipynb)
